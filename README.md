This is crosscompiler used to create kernel of my OS. This is strictly hobby project, so don't expect any progress here.

It was created using OSDev tutorial located [here](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler).

Note - this is Fedora oriented (hence instalation of development packages at the beggining), but should work on any Linux distribution after minor tweaks.
